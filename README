Readme for maplestoryrankingdatacollector
Sean Hogan, 3/9/11

tokens.l is a flex parser that parses ranking data so we only get a line of data with ranking, name, world, level.

mapleget.sh is a shell script for grabbing a page off of the maplestory website from the legendary rankings, and head/tailing it to only get the data we want to parse. I think this is a bit problematic, hardcoding these values in. It might be nice to convert this to a tree structure somehow - my friend did this with a python API. It takes three arguments - the start rank, end rank, and output file.

maplegetdeme.sh is similar to mapleget.sh, but works for the world rankings for the Demethos world (server). The arguments are the same.

database.py uses sqlite interface to build a database from the formatted data produced by the flex. It takes one argument, the semi-raw data from the shell script, and outputs a sqlite database.

The order is...

shell -> flex -> python (sqlite) -> some sort of analysis, I'd presume.

Problems with this:

-Hardcoding of values
-Latency on retrieving webpages. Currently to get a nice amount of data I am sshing into my school's computers and running the webpage getting script multiple times.
